# ember-primer

Ember Primer is a collection of data visualization primitives (components) which
can be composed together to construct ambitious data visualizations and interactive
presentations.

#### Primer has 3 design goals:

1. Primer is built on D3 (using `ember-d3` with D3.js 4.x), it should enable 
developers to efficiently construct presentations without concerning 
themselves with `insert/update/merge` semantics of D3.js,
2. Presentation and data should be separate concerns, allowing for data processing
to be done at a higher level and passed down to the presentation layer,
3. Interaction and animation layers should be composed separately from the visual
primitives.

#### It it Production Readyâ„¢?

No, not yet.

#### Is it awesome?

Yes.

# Installation

Installation is simple, run:

```
ember install ember-primer
```

If installation fails, please ensure your project is using at least the minimum
requirements of:

- NodeJS `>= 6`
- npm `>= 3`
- Ember CLI `>= 2.10`
- Ember `>= 2.10`

# Usage

*The following is an implementation goal, and the status of these APIs is in flux.*

## 0. The `primer-plot` component

This component inserts an SVG tag and exposes the dimensions of the chart for
positioning scaling of data and controls.

Example usage:

```hbs
{{#primer-plot (auto-size margin="16 8" padding="10") as |primer|}}
  ...
{{/primer-plot}}

```

`primer-plot <dimensions>`

You can either supply fixed dimensions with a hash:

```hbs
primer-plot (hash width=640 height=320)
```

Or use the `auto-size` helper to calculate the dimensions based on the containing
element.
